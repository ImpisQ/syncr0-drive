            <h2>The Story & Idea</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>

              Welcome to Syncro-Drive, a community of car enthusiast dedicated to sharing drtiving skills for better motoring safety and
              control.<br>
              It all started as a drive back home in the wee hours of a wintery misty and foggy morning.<br>
              Out of nowhere a huge deer appeared right on the edge of the left lane from the right and appeared to be oblivious to the headlights and approching car.<br>
              The approximate distance would have been between 5-10 metres.<br>  
              In just a matter of split seconds, a lot of things happened at once.<br>
              My initial reaction was to pump the breaks while trying to swerve around the deer whilst thinking about potential traffc in the right lane.<br>
              What happened next was akin to hitting a brick wall, an explosive whoosh of the airbags and a sudden loss of visibility as the bonnet slammed into the windscreen.<br>
              Neither the deer nor the car survived.<br>
              Much later after going through all the standard procedures with the Garda and insurance company, a thought occured  as to whether this could have been avoided.
              So armed with a list of question, I set about looking for answers to a particular set of questions with regards to what I could have done differently.<br>
              And thus the idea of Syncro-Drive was born.
              To change the way we dgo about our day to day driving by applying tried and tested professional skills.
              And here we are with a growing and ever expanding community of people looking to hone their driving skills in addition to lowering their insurance premiums.
