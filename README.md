## User Experience (UX)

### Site Purpose:
This is the introductory website to Syncro-Drive.
The concept of creating a community of enthusiasts for safer, better, faster more responsive driving skills is at the heart of Syncro-Drive. 

The inspiration for Syncro-Drive came from a combination of different frustrations with motoring in Ireland.
Among these are high and exorbitant insurance premiums, with very limited options on the market.
Driving school lessons are less than adequate when compared to most European standards and thus a lot of bad drivers on the road.
We shall not even talk about inconsistent speed limits.
And so came the idea of creating a legaly recognised skill-set that might be able to address some of these frustrations whilst building a community and space for enthusiasts.

### Site Goal:
Our site has been set up to provide an option for signing up for a particular skill-set of their choice with industry professionals running the training, whilst retaining an element of a fun and social community.


## Design

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are White and Orange.

### Typography
The Tilt Neon font is the font used for headings on all pages 4 website pages whilst paragraphs and text use Lato with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
